\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

\e AirInvClient is a small program sending and receiving simple JSON-formatted
   messages to the <a href="http://zeromq.org">ZeroMQ</a>-based server
  (AirInvServer). The aim of that client is to test that the AirInv server
  is up and running, and that it receives and sends JSON requests.

\e AirInvClient does not accept any option for now. Do not hesitate 
   to contribute!
